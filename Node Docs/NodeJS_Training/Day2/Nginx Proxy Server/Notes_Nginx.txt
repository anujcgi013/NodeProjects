-->   Nginx HTTPS Reverse Proxy Overview. 

	
		A Nginx HTTPS reverse proxy is an intermediary proxy service which takes a client request, passes it on to one or more servers, and subsequently delivers the server's response back to the client. ... By using a Nginx reverse proxy all applications can benefit from these features.

	
	
Download the nginx software from the below url:

--> Download, Extract and copy the folder and paste C:\ Drive.

		c:\>
			[  nginx-1.21.1  ]
			
			
Update  the configuration file for port number. by default it refers 80, if want to change update the config file:

	File Path:  	C:\nginx-1.21.1\conf\nginx.conf
	
	Go to server Section in the above file:
	
		 server {
                        listen       80;
                        server_name  localhost;
                        ....

	Check the server is running or not by browsing the following url:
			
			Url:			http://localhost:8070/
			
			It will show welcome  to Nginx   message  --- web page. 


Run the tasklist command-line utility to see nginx processes:

C:\nginx-1.21.1>tasklist /fi "imagename eq nginx.exe"



Note:  We recommend that each time you complete a set of updates to the configuration, you run the nginx -t command to test the configuration file for syntactic validity.

C:\nginx-1.21.1>nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file C:\nginx-1.21.1/conf/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file C:\nginx-1.21.1/conf/nginx.conf test is successful
